        Hello! My name is Jaisal. I'm an international student at El Camino College 	pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology. I come 	from a multicultural background. I was born in India but grew up in Panama 	which has helped me become very adaptable to new environments, such as 	learning a new programming language. I enjoy exploring new web application 	tools and software. My goal is to continue growing as a programmer and 	build a career that combines technology with creativity.
